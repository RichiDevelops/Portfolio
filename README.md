Welcome!

Here I have gathered several projects on which I have worked independently or collaborated. Not all projects are listed, only the most important and comprehensive ones.

This portfolio is intended to demonstrate my ability to work with a broad range of technologies, learn new tools efficiently, and apply them in practical software projects.

The projects are categorized into [Work](#work-disclaimer-due-to-confidentiality-all-work-related-content-is-kept-non-specific), [University](#university),  and [Leisure](#leisure-fun-projects).

My current main tech stack consists of Python for backend and React (Web) / Flutter (Mobile) for frontend development.

Happy exploring!
